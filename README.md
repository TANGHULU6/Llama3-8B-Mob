## (HuMob'24 @ACM SIGSPATIAL) Instruction-Tuning Llama-3-8B Excels in City-Scale Mobility Prediction
![](Visualization/llama3-8b-mob-demo.gif)
### üìñ Introduction 
**Llama-3-8B-Mob** is a large language model designed for **long-term human mobility prediction across multiple cities**. Leveraging instruction tuning, it models complex spatial-temporal patterns in human mobility data to predict future trajectories over extended periods. Our model was validated on real-world human mobility data from four metropolitan areas in Japan, showcasing significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art models.

### ‚≠ê Highlights
- **Instruction-Tuned LLM**: Llama-3-8B-Mob employs instruction-tuning, allowing it to handle mobility prediction in a flexible Q&A format.
- **Long-term Mobility Prediction**: Unlike most models that focus on short-term prediction, Llama-3-8B-Mob excels in predicting individual trajectories up to 15 days in advance.
- **Cross-City Generalization**: Fine-tuned on a single city, Llama-3-8B-Mob demonstrates impressive _zero-shot generalization to other cities_ without needing city-specific data.
- **Superior Performance**: 1st in Mean Rank, 2nd in Trajectory Semantic Similarity, and 3rd in Trajectory Shape Similarity in [Human Mobility Prediction Challenge@SIGSPATIAL](https://wp.nyu.edu/humobchallenge2024/), 2024.

### üì¶ Dependencies
Dependencies can be installed using the following command: (works in 2025/01/06)
```
conda create --name llm_mob \
    python=3.10 \
    pytorch-cuda=12.1 \
    pytorch cudatoolkit xformers=0.0.26 -c pytorch -c nvidia -c xformers \
    -y

conda activate llm_mob

pip install "unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git@d1f3b6c1c4f69cd09ebdcab014bd72ac1217ee71"
pip install --no-deps trl==0.8.6 peft==0.11.1 accelerate==0.32.1 bitsandbytes==0.43.1

conda install -y scipy=1.12.0

pip install wandb==0.17.8 
pip install pandas==2.2.2
pip install transformers==4.42.4
pip uninstall -y numpy && pip install numpy==1.26.4
```
If you encounter issues while configuring the environment, it's normal.

I provided the [environment.yml](environment.yml), but it's **not recommended** to rely on it. Conda can be slow and may crash easily.

You can refer to the [official unsloth repository](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) guide or try to fix the issues using manual package management commands.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo 
You can run the demo to experience the predictive capabilities of Llama-3-8B-Mob with the following command:
```
python demo.py
```
**Note**: Enter `work` for human mobility trajectory inference, enter `chat` to interact with Llama-3-8B-Mob freely.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Usage 
To get started with Llama-3-8B-Mob, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from the [official source](https://wp.nyu.edu/humobchallenge2024/datasets/), or use a custom dataset with a similar format.
2. Modify the configuration in [make_dataset.py](./tools/Data_tools/make_dataset.py), and then execute the script to convert the data into conversation datasets. You may need to upgrade the version of numpy and pandas if you encounter any error.
```
python tools/Data_tools/make_dataset.py
```
3. Login your wandb account and try your first own finetuning!
```
python Finetune_Llama3.py
```
4. Evaluate the performance of the finetuned model!
```
python Evaluate_Llama3.py
```
5. Infer with Llama-3-8B-Mob.
```
python infer.py --l_idx <left_index> --r_idx <right_index> --city <city_abbreviation>
```
